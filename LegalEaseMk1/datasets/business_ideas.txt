''Idea:'' A quirky café that exclusively serves sandwiches made from leftover food. The idea is to promote sustainability by creating sandwiches using “rescued” produce, meats, and bread that would otherwise go to waste. You could market it as a "surprise sandwich of the day," where the ingredients change daily based on what's available. It might attract adventurous eaters or people passionate about reducing food waste, but it also sounds like a concept only a "dumpster diver" could dream up. Food safety and handling regulations would be a significant concern.

''Summary:'' Café serving sandwiches made from leftover food. Offers a "surprise sandwich of the day." Requires strict adherence to food safety regulations.

''Idea:'' A business where people can rent private nap pods by the hour in busy, high-traffic areas like malls, offices, or parks.

Think of it as a modern take on a "nap hotel" but without the commitment of staying overnight. Each pod would come with a blanket, pillow, and calming ambient sounds.

''Idea:'' A telephone service where pet owners can call in to have their pets "talked to" by a psychic who claims to communicate with animals. People could describe their pets, and the psychic would then "channel" the pet’s thoughts and feelings. This could be marketed as a fun, lighthearted way to understand what your cat or dog might be thinking, even if it’s just complete nonsense. It’s one of those "wouldn’t it be funny?" ideas that could gain some attention just for its oddity.  This business would likely operate as a sole proprietorship.

''Summary:'' Telephone service where a psychic communicates with pets. Operates as a sole proprietorship.

''Idea:'' An art gallery that doesn’t actually show any art. Visitors pay an entry fee to walk around the gallery and enjoy the concept of "art" without ever actually seeing anything on the walls. Instead, the space could be entirely empty, with "descriptions" of the invisible artwork or audio guides explaining the "depths" of what they would have seen, if it existed. It’s a high-concept idea that could get attention from art lovers, or just confuse people enough to make them laugh.  Marketing this concept would be crucial.

''Summary:'' Art gallery featuring no actual art. Visitors pay to experience the concept of "invisible art." Requires strong marketing.

''Idea:'' Okay, so hear me out. I was thinking—Seattle gets so much rain, right? So maybe I could start this umbrella rental service? Like, people could rent umbrellas when it starts raining and just drop them off at designated spots when they’re done. I don’t know, it might work, but what if people forget to return the umbrellas? Or what if people just bring their own? But still, it could be cool for tourists, right? Maybe it’s a terrible idea. I don’t know.  Tracking and retrieval of umbrellas would be a major logistical challenge.

''Summary:'' Umbrella rental service with designated drop-off spots. Faces logistical challenges in tracking and retrieving umbrellas.

''Idea:'' So, I was thinking... what if there was this thing, like a “grown-up sleepover” experience? You’d get a group of adults together, provide snacks, movies, blankets, and then—just hang out like when we were kids. But instead of pizza rolls, we could have fancy snacks? I don’t know, would people be into that? It sounds fun, but also kind of weird for adults, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s one of those things that seems good in theory but... eh, I’m not sure.  Liability waivers and background checks for staff would be important considerations.

''Summary:'' "Grown-up sleepover" experience with snacks, movies, and activities. Requires liability waivers and staff background checks.

''Idea:'' Okay, hear me out on this one. A store that only sells mismatched socks. Like, all the socks are singles or come in weird pairs, like one striped, one solid color. Could be a fun, quirky concept, right? People could buy socks for cheap, and maybe it’s some kind of statement on how we’re all unique, or something like that. But... I don’t know if people would actually want to buy socks that don’t match. Would anyone even get the point? It might just be... silly? I’m unsure.  Inventory management would be unique to this business model.

''Summary:'' Store selling only mismatched socks.  Requires unique inventory management.

''Idea:'' What if there was a drive-thru, but instead of getting just ice cream, you’d get a mix of toppings? Like, you’d pick your toppings, and then they’d serve it to you in a bowl, and you could add it to whatever ice cream you already have? But would people even use that? Maybe people just want the full ice cream experience, not just toppings. I mean, the drive-thru idea is cool, but... maybe it’s unnecessary. I’m not sure.  This business model might be best operated as a franchise.

''Summary:'' Drive-thru topping service for ice cream.  Franchise model may be optimal.

''Idea:'' Okay, here’s a thought. Maybe I could start a home library loan service? Like, people could sign up, and I’d deliver books to their door for a week at a time. It’s kind of like a mix between a library and a book delivery service, but I don’t know if people would actually want to pay for that. There are already libraries, right? Maybe people would rather just go to a local bookstore or something. But, I don’t know, maybe there’s something in it. I’m really not sure if it would work, though.  Insurance for the books would be a key business expense.

''Summary:'' Home library loan service with book delivery. Requires insurance for books.

''Idea:'' Okay, so what if I started a vertical farming business in the city? Seattle has this growing interest in sustainability, and I’m thinking it could be really cool to use unused urban spaces—like rooftops or old warehouses—to grow fresh produce vertically. The idea is that we could sell locally grown, fresh herbs, vegetables, and greens to restaurants or directly to consumers. But I’m not sure—would people really buy into the idea of farmed-in-the-city produce? There might be logistical challenges, too. But still, it could work, right? I’m kind of torn on whether it’s too niche.  Securing lease agreements for urban spaces would be a major hurdle.

''Summary:'' Urban vertical farming business selling produce to restaurants and consumers.  Lease agreements for urban spaces are crucial.

''Idea:'' What if there were vending machines, but instead of junk food, they sold healthy snacks and meals? Like, protein bars, salads, smoothies, maybe even fresh fruit bowls or yogurt parfaits. They could be placed in gyms, office buildings, or schools where people want healthy options on the go. I don’t know... it sounds like a great idea for a health-conscious market, but would people actually use them? Are people really ready to pay $5 for a protein bar from a vending machine? I'm not sure, but it could be a niche worth exploring.  Maintaining the freshness of the food would be a key operational challenge.

I could have in-home visits or even offer virtual tutorials. The thing is, I’m not sure if there’s enough of a market for this—maybe it’s too specific? But, with the population aging, I feel like it could be a much-needed service. It might take time to build up trust, though. I’m just not sure if there’s enough demand.  Background checks for staff would be essential for in-home visits.

''Idea:'' What if I started a luxury pet concierge service that caters to high-end clients? It would be a personalized service where I do everything for people’s pets—walk them, take them to the groomer, set up playdates, and maybe even arrange pet-friendly vacations or experiences. I could partner with local pet spas or luxury hotels that cater to pets. It could be a niche, but I’m wondering—are people really going to spend that much money on their pets? It could be an upscale market, but it might be a little too out of reach for most pet owners. Still, it’s worth considering.

''Idea:'' With more people working remotely now, I was thinking about starting a service that helps remote workers plan personalized travel experiences. So, instead of a typical vacation, I’d create a travel itinerary that helps people work remotely from a different city or country for a few weeks or months. The package would include accommodations, co-working space access, and recommendations for remote-friendly activities. But I’m unsure if this is something people really want. There’s a market for remote work travel, but would people be willing to pay for a customized experience when they could probably just do it on their own?

It could cater to couples, families, or even corporate clients looking for unique team-building experiences. I’m not sure though, would people actually pay that much for a picnic? But it seems like a fun idea... maybe too niche?  Permits and insurance for operating in public spaces would be required.

''Summary:'' Luxury picnic setup service in local parks and scenic spots.  Permits and insurance are required.

''Idea:'' What if I created a mobile health testing business? Like a van or trailer that goes around offering quick health screenings—things like blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests, glucose testing, even COVID-19 tests—without people having to go to a doctor. I think it could be great for underserved communities or busy people who don’t have time for a full check-up. The problem is, I’m not sure about the regulations or the initial investment, and I don’t know if people would trust a mobile testing unit. Still, I think there could be potential.  Strict adherence to health regulations and licensing would be mandatory.

I could curate monthly boxes with unique, locally-sourced snacks from around Washington and the Pacific Northwest. It could include everything from small-batch jerky to locally-made chocolates and artisanal chips.

I could create virtual tours of famous places or even offer immersive nature experiences from Washington's national parks. It might be a niche market, but there’s potential in the VR space. The thing is, I’m unsure if the technology will be accessible enough for everyone, and if people will actually want to pay for a virtual experience rather than a real one. Still, it could be interesting.  Securing rights to locations and developing high-quality VR content would be crucial.
