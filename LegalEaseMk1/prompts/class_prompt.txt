Receive the Summary:
You will be provided with a summarized version of a business idea.

Classify the Business Type:
After reviewing the summary, classify the business into one of the following categories:

LLC (Limited Liability Company): Choose this if the business is small to medium in size, has owners with personal liability protection, and is more focused on flexibility and less on raising large amounts of capital.
Non-Profit: Choose this if the business idea has a clear social or charitable mission with no intention of distributing profits to owners or shareholders.
CORP (Corporation): Choose this if the business aims to raise capital, has shareholders, and is looking to expand at a larger scale. This is usually suited for companies planning to go public or have many investors.
OTHER: If the business idea does not fit into any of the three categories and would be better suited to another business structure (e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, cooperative, etc.), classify it as "OTHER".
BAD_IDEA: Choose this if the business idea is clearly unfeasible, unrealistic, or lacks a solid basis to succeed.
